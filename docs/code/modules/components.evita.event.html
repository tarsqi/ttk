event.py

The Event class here is used by Evita when creating a new event by
Chunk._processEventInChunk() or AdjectiveToken._processEventInToken().</pre>


<a name="Event"/><div class="section">class Event</div>
<pre>

Instances of this class are created by Evita when it finds a new
event. Instances have a short life because all that they are used for is to
be added to the TarsqiDocument as a Tag instance.

Instance variables:
  tokens  -  a list of Tokens or AdjectiveTokens
  attrs   -  the TimeML attributes of the event

The eid and eiid identifiers are not set by this class, they are added later
when the TarsqiTree adds the event to the TarsqiDocument. Also note that
the nf_morph is value is added to the POS attribute.</pre>

<blockquote>
<h3>Public Functions</h3>
<pre>
<div class=function>__init__(self, feats)</div>
Initialize from an instance of a subclass of ChunkFeatures. Creates
the list of tokens for the event from just the head of the chunk because
currently Evita only recognizes one-token events (in line with the old
TimeML specifications), the list is a hook for adding multi-token events
later. Modality and polarity are not added if they have the default
values.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>__str__(self)</div>
