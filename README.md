# The Tarsqi Toolkit

This is the main repository for the Tarsqi Toolkit (TTK), a set of processing components for extracting temporal information from news wire texts. TTK extracts time expressions, events, subordination links and temporal links; in addition, it can ensure consistency of temporal information.

To use the Tarsqi Toolkit first either clone this repository or download the most recent release from https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk/releases, then follow the instructions in the manual at `docs/manual/index.html`. Manuals can also be browsed on the [TimeML website](http://timeml.org/tarsqi/toolkit/docs/versions/).
