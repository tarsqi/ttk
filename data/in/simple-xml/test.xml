Mr. Vinken got the flue on Nov. 29th. John fell after Mary pushed him? They
heard an explosion on Monday, but not in 2007. This reminded them of the 1968
war, which ravaged the countryside in 1969. He slept on Friday night. He began

succeed before noon. Gonzalez said he would resign on Tuesday. He thought it was

leave today. <CRAP>The Dr.</CRAP> The new Dr. Weird: [] We're in line and won't
you know. My name "is" W.F. Hermans. <!-- comment -->
